# Machine_Learning-AUEB

The current project is implemented in the context of the course "Machine Learning" at the Department of Informatics, AUEB. Its objective is to introduce students to key Machine Learning algorithms, including vanilla Feedforward Neural Networks for supervised learning and Expectation-Maximization algorithm for unsupervised learning, all implemented from scratch using solely NumPy.
