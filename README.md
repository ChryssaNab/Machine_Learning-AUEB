# aueb-machine_learning

The current project is implemented in the context of the course "Machine Learning" in the Department of Informatics (AUEB). The aim of the project is to familiarize the students with Machine Learning algorithms such as Feedforward Neural Networks (supervised learning) and Expectation-Maximization algorithm (unsupervised learning) using NumPy.

### 1st Assignment: Feedforward Neural Network for Image Classification
